This is a little script that will renew your books from the Chicago Public Library.
Shh!!!! Don't tell Rahm!!!

Anyway, to use it, edit login.ini to contain your card number and zip code.
It's the same stuff you use to log onto the CPL website.

Then, add a cron job and never worry about library fines again!
(Except for the three-renewal limit.)

Example crontab!
0 10 12 * * cd <path_to_wherever>/Chicago-Public-Library-Tool/ && ./renew

But seriously, finish your books.  Return your books.  Libraries are awesome.
